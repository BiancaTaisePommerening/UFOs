# UFOs
UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to build a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs, where the user can filter through multiple options, on which the website visually displays the result of the selection criteria simultaneously and at the same time deliver a visually appealing and interactive webpage.



# Design Solution

- A table was created to hold the UFOs data
- Filters for searching criteria were added to that table 
- The table was then inserted on the index.html file
- A header, article summary, and brief article were added to the page.
- Basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS were used to build ans style the webpage.


## Results

### Webpage

- UFOs Sighting webpage

- Data Table without any filter applied

### Search Criteria

In order to use the search option, the user would click on the space where it says "Enter Date" and enter the date of their choice to see if there was any UFO been seen on that specific date.

- Applying one filter
    - Enter Date: "1/12/2010"

To add another filter, for example a city, on the space where it says "chicago", which is the default city set as the example, the user would type the desired city such as "wichita". Now both the Date and City filters have been applied, and the results from that are displayed on the table data to the right of the search options. Every time a user changes the inputs on the filters, the table changes accordingly to display the results.


- Applying two filters
    - Enter Date: "1/12/2010"
    - Enter a city: "wichita"
